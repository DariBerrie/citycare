[Ouicity](http://www.ouicity.me/) is a project conceived during Le Wagon's Batch #986 Fullstack Web Development bootcamp. 
The app's purpose is to connect residents with city management and planning institutions using an interactive approach that gets both sides involved in caring for their city. 

Two sides are represented on this app. The front-facing side (login: user@user.com, pwd: 123456) used by residents is intended for mobile use. The back-face side (login: worker@worker.com, pwd: 123456) for the city is intended for desktop use.

This was a great way for the team to combine what we've learned over the course of six months. Try it out, or [check out our demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylBPh9zTMaM&ab_channel=LeWagon) and let us know what you think!

ðŸŒŸFun fact: The name "Ouicity" was inspired by "ouistiti" the word said before taking pictures in France. It's equivalent is "Cheese!" in English. Ouisiti is actually a kind of monkey and we'd like to think that our logo (and app) make you smile when you see it!
